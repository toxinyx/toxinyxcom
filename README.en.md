```

And modify the theme in `hugo.toml`

```toml
theme = 'hugo-theme-reimu'
```

## Usage

<details>
<summary>Create Configuration</summary>

### Creating Configuration

#### Theme Configuration

Create a `_default` folder within the outer `config` directory, then copy `config/_default/params.yml` from the theme into this `_default` folder. This file serves as the theme configuration file, allowing theme settings to be modified.

#### Data Configuration

Copy all files from the theme's `config/data/` folder to the outer `data` folder. These files in the data folder are used to configure theme data:

- `covers.yml` to configure random cover images
- `friends.yml` to configure friend links
- `vendor.yml` to configure CDN sources for third-party libraries

#### Static Resource Configuration

Static resources for the theme (favicon, header images, etc.) are located in the `static` folder. You can create corresponding folders in the outer `static` directory and copy files from the theme to replace default files.

> In general, it is recommended not to modify the theme files directly. Instead, create corresponding folders in the outer directories and copy theme files into them to overwrite defaults. This makes upgrading the theme easier.

<details>

<summary>Basic Structure</summary>

### Basic Structure

To ensure correct display, refer to `_example` and create `archives` and `post` folders in the `content` directory (the `_index.md` inside cannot be omitted, and note that the `draft` in `post` is `true`)

#### archives

- `_index.md` used to display the archive page, cannot be omitted

#### post

Create articles in this directory, and note that articles with `draft` set to `true` will not be displayed on the homepage

- `_index.md` used to ignore the generation of `post/index.html`, cannot be omitted

#### about\.md

About page

#### friend\.md

Friend link page

</details>

<details>
<summary>Cover, Banner, and favicon</summary>

#### Cover

The logic for displaying the cover is as follows

- If the article's Front matter contains the url for cover, the article's header image and home page thumbnails display that url

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
cover: https://example.com
---
```

- If the article's Front matter contains cover as `false`, the article doesn't show the header image (it's still a random image on the front page)

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
cover: false
---
```

- If the article's Front matter contains cover as `rgb(xxx,xxx,xxx)`, the article's header image is the corresponding gradient solid color (still a random image on the front page)

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
cover: rgb(255,117,117)
---
```

- Otherwise, look for the `data` folder and `covers.yml` and pick a random image from it
- If none of these files exist, display the banner

#### banner

The banner is stored in `themes/hugo-theme-reimu/static/images/banner.webp` and can be modified in the `params.yml`

```yaml
banner: "images/banner.webp"
```

#### favicon

The icon is stored in `themes/hugo-theme-reimu/static/favicon.ico` and can be replaced by overwriting it

</details>
<details>
<summary>Code Highlighting</summary>

### Code Highlighting

To ensure that the code blocks are displayed correctly, please ensure that the `hugo.yml` is configured as follows

```toml
[markup.highlight]
guessSyntax = true
noClasses = false
```

The code block also provides a code paste function. Click the copy button in the upper right corner of the code block to copy the code. In the `params.yml`, you can configure the copy function.  
`success` is the prompt when the copy is successful, and `fail` is the prompt when the copy fails. In addition, you can configure the copyright statement. When the number of characters copied is greater than `count`, the content copied will be followed by the `content` copyright.

```yaml
clipboard:
  success: 复制成功(*^▽^*)
  fail: 复制失败 (ﾟ⊿ﾟ)ﾂ
  copyright:
    enable: false
    count: 50 # The number of characters when the copyright is displayed

<summary>Site comments</summary>

### Site comments

> In-site comments can be controlled independently of each post using `comments` in Front matter.  
> Comments are not shown when `comments` is `false`, and are shown or not shown when `true` or not filled in, depending on the `_config.yml` configuration.
